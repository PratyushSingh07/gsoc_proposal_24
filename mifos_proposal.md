# **1. Project Idea**

Abstract
- 

The project focuses on the enhancement and refinement of a feature-rich and secure Mobile Wallet application tailored for Government to Person (G2P) payments, demonstrating a potent tool for fintechs and financial institutions. Originating as a Google Summer of Code initiative from 2017-2023, the project delivered the initial mobile wallet framework, evolving into a sophisticated reference application with two primary apps: PixieCollect and MifosPay, later consolidating focus on MifosPay. The developmental trajectory of the project saw significant milestones: integration with Mojaloop transaction flows, user experience enhancements, support for Kotlin, and implementation of standing instructions and merchant transactions. Further advancements include integration with Fineract CN, multi-theme support, migration to Kotlin, and a transition towards a multiplatform approach using Kotlin multi-platform. The project aims, in 2024, to finalize G2P functionalities, ensuring production-readiness, improving security, and adopting modern development practices such as Jetpack Compose and leveraging Mifos' Android SDK. It underscores a commitment to evolving into a generic wallet management system through the Mifos X framework, incorporating cutting-edge features like the latest Payment Hub EE version, a new notifications framework, and a redesigned architecture to align with the Open Wallet Foundation's principles. This ambitious endeavor promises to redefine the landscape of mobile wallets, emphasizing security, extensibility, and a seamless user experience for G2P payments and beyond.

### **Issues Reported**
- I had opened a total of **15 issues** that mainly focused on bugs that were present in the codebase and also on the features that were absent from the mifos mobile at the time . Some of them are still open and have PRs either by me or from my fellow contributors 
- All of my open and closed issues can be accessed from [here](https://github.com/openMF/mifos-mobile/issues/created_by/PratyushSingh07) 

# **4. Week Wise Breakdown**

## **4.1 Community Bonding Period (1 May - 26 May)**

### *Week 1*
- Get in touch with the developers and the mentor
- Introduction to the community, to the mentor and fix timings to communicate
- Discuss any suggestions and changes to the project. There could modifications, new additions or amendments; it would be better to go over these early 

### *Week 2*
- Go Through Mifos-Mobile codebase 
- Take reference from android client and try to implement features that are currently absent in mifos-mobile
- Go through the Open Banking API and related documentations 

### *Week 3*
- Discuss the working of the existing application with the mentor. Discuss the implementations of the new features
- Go over the new design in detail and ask for changes and suggestions
- Discuss the changes that need to take place in the frontend to accommodate  for the breaking changes

## **4.2 Phase 1 (27 May - 12 July)**

### *Week 4*

- I will start off gradually with the migration from MVP to MVVM architectural style
- The order that I will follow is : 
    - Splash Activity
    - Login Activity
    - Registration Fragment
    - PassCode Activity
    - HomeOld Fragment 
    - Home Fragment and so on
- This order is somewhat sequential and will be one of the first steps to be undertaken
- I would also take inputs from my mentors and if the need arises, change the order of the migration 

### *Week 5*

- I would dedicate this week to the implementation of the Navigation graph
- I would start off by grouping the fragments that are connected in a sequential flow and map out a graph for the same in the xml
- This would require the addition of FragmentContainerView in certain activities which will allow further FragmentTransaction operations on the FragmentContainerView and provide a consistent timing for lifecycle events.

### *Week 6*

- This week would be reserved for the migration from dagger to hilt & also for the integration of coroutines in the project
- Considering the fact that we need to write unit tests as well, Hilt will make it easier to write unit tests for the code by allowing us to easily swap out dependencies with mock objects 
- Hence it will be better to get on with this at the earliest so that we can lay foundation for a better unit test phase

### *Week 7*

- In this, week I will replace existing api layer from self service fineract to Open Banking
- We can take reference from the [Open Banking App](https://github.com/openMF/open-banking-app) while implementing it in our project 
- I will be communicating with the mentors and taking their valuable inputs especially when dealing with the endpoints that we have to hit  

### *Week 8 and Rest of Phase 1*

- *Buffer* for any pending tasks
- Prepare a report for evaluation
- Discuss brief plan for Phase 2 with the mentors


## **4.3 Phase 2 (12 July - 26 Aug)**

### *Week 10*

- Rocket chat will provide users with the support and facility of fast solutions to their queries. Rocket chat will provide users to communicate securely in real-time.
 <!-- refer rocket chat lib here https://gist.github.com/ShivangiSingh17/67b6041387c1e281caa7df23347f549e -->
- Shivangi singh had already updated the callbacks in the library and had further added lifecycle to decline requests . The library can be found [here](https://github.com/ShivangiSingh17/mifos-Rocket.Chat)
- Now all is left to be done is the integration into the project and I will integrate this once I get the updated *APIs* during the GSoC period

### *Week 11*

- I will dedicate this week for the integration of mojaloop via the payment hub. Currently Mobile wallet already has this feature and the same can be taken as a reference while implementing it in mifos mobile
- I will consult with my mentor the API endpoints that needs to be hit for transactions, registrations, identification and so on

### *Week 12*

- I shall be writing unit tests for the data layer in this week of GSoC
- Uptill here we would have migrated a certain portion of our project to MVVM and hence the tests can now be written keeping the new architecture in mind
- I shall be using Mockito framework to write the tests

### *Week 13* 

- This week will be dedicated to performing the UI tests using espresso whose dependencies are already present in the gradle
- We will have decent amount of changes to the UI uptill here and hence tests that cover all the screens must be put in place
- This will ensure that the views are displayed correctly and look the way they're supposed to.Besides it will ensure that the interactions are handled correctly.

### *Week 14* 

- After writing all the unit tests I will add appropriate jobs in the existing workflow to run these tests
- Running tests regularly and automating the testing process can save a lot of time and prevent issues from arising in the codebase

### *Week 15 and Rest of Phase 2*

- If the mentors permit then I would like to implement my own ideas. Considering the ideas aren't that cumbersome it will work out even if its accomplished at the end of the project
- *Buffer* to complete any remaining tasks
- Prepare report for evaluation

    ![Priority Chart](PriorityChart.jpg)

## **4.4 Post Phase 2 (After Aug 26)**
- Discuss the project's outcome with my mentors and devise a plan of action for future contributions
- Engage with members of the community to solicit feedback on project implementation and to identify possible add-on features

# **8. Career Goals**
As an android developer my first and foremost goal is to master the Android SDK,Multithreading and other related technologies and create a portfolio of projects that would include personal projects, open source contributions, or projects done as part of my studies or work.
As I gain more experience , I would want to specialize in UI/UX design along with enterprise app development and seek out for leadership roles. 
I would sooner or later venture into AOSP and get a grasp of low level android as well and transition into a full stack mobile developer.
I am self taught like many other developers out there and Open Source Projects have played an integral part in my growth and thus I would give back to this android community by sharing my knowledge and expertise through blog posts, tutorials,speaking engagements and of course by contributing to Open Source Projects.
